# CSCTF 2024

## introduction
first things first this was a nice competition in a long while that allowed our team ([n0qtr](https://ctftime.org/team/179569)) to warm-up for future challenges. that said, I am thankful for taking part in this competition and can only credit this to [Radu Marin](https://chronossec.site/) and his team behind all this. let's get to the actual writeup!

## ... that was not all i had to say
because there was a total of 68 exercises out of which we managed to complete 53 the actual writeup will be split up into its corresponding categories. as far for the challenges that I will cover in this writeup, I will not cover the challenges that my team members have completed such that I don't claim unnecessary credit. have fun! :)
